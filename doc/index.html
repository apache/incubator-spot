            <h1>Environment</h1>
            <h2>Pure Hadoop</h2>

            <p>Apache Spot (incubating) can be installed on a new or existing Hadoop cluster, its components viewed as services and distributed according to common roles in the cluster. One approach is to follow the community validated deployment of Hadoop (see diagram below).</p>

            <p>This approach is recommended for customers with a dedicated cluster for use of the solution or a security data lake; it takes advantage of existing investment in hardware and software. The disadvantage of this approach is that it does require
              the installation of software on Hadoop nodes not managed by systems like Cloudera Manager.</p>

            <p class="center"><a href="../library/images/service-layout.png"><img src="../library/images/service-layout.png" alt="Service Layout" /></a></p>

            <p>In the Pure Hadoop deployment scenario, the ingest component runs on an edge node, which is an expected use of this role. It is required to install some non-Hadoop software to make ingest component work. The Operational Analytics runs on a
              node intended for browser-based management and user applications, so that all user interfaces are located on a node or nodes with the same role. The Machine Learning (ML) component is installed on worker nodes, as the resource management
              for an ML pipeline is similar for functions inside and outside Hadoop.</p>

            <p>Although both of these deployment options are validated and supported, additional scenarios that combine these approaches are certainly.</p>

                <strong>Minimum required version:</strong> 5.7<br>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> Spot requires Spark 2.1.0 if you are using Spark 1.6 please upgrade your Spark version to 2.1.0.</p>

              <p class="orange-bold" style="margin-bottom:0;">There are four components in apache spot (incubating):</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>spot-setup</strong> &mdash; scripts that create the required HDFS paths, hive tables and configuration for apache spot (incubating).</li>
                <li><strong>spot-ingest</strong> &mdash; binary and log files are captured or transferred into the Hadoop cluster, where they are transformed and loaded into solution data stores.</li>
                <li><strong>spot-ml</strong> &mdash; ​machine learning algorithms are used for anomaly detection.</li>
                <li><strong>spot-oa</strong>&mdash; data output from the machine learning component is augmented with context and heuristics, then is available to the user for interacting with it.</li>
              </ul>
              While all of the components can be installed on the same server in a development or test scenario, the recommended configuration for production is to map the components to specific server roles in a Hadoop cluster.<br><br>

              <h3>3. Configuring the cluster.</h3>
              <h4 class="gray">3.1 Create a user account for apache spot (incubating).</h4>
              <p>
                Before starting the installation, the recommended approach is to create a user account with super user privileges (sudo) and with access to HDFS in each one of the nodes where apache spot (incubating) is going to be installed ( i.e. edge server, yarn
                node).<br>
              </p>

              <p class="orange-bold">Add user to all apache spot (incubating) nodes:</p>
              <p class="terminal">
                sudo adduser &#60;solution-user&#62;<br> passwd &#60;solution-user&#62;
              </p>

              <p>For unattended execution of the ML pipeline, a public key authentication will be required. Log on to the first ML node (usually the lowest-numbered node). and create a private key for the solution user. Then you will need to copy those credentials
                to each node used for ML.</p>

              <p>[soluser@node04] ssh-keygen -t rsa<br /> [soluser@node04] ssh-copy-id soluser@node04<br /> [soluser@node04] ssh-copy-id soluser@node05<br /> …..
                <br /> [soluser@node04] ssh-copy-id soluser@node15</p>

              <p>The sample above assumes that the solution-user is “soluser” and there are 12 nodes used for ML. Now do the same for the UI node.</p>

              <p>[soluser@node04] ssh-copy-id soluser@node03</p>

              <p class="orange-bold">Add user to HDFS supergroup (IMPORTANT: this should be done in the Name Node) :</p>
              <p class="terminal">
                sudo usermod -G supergroup $username
              </p><br>

              <h4 class="gray">3.2 Get the code.</h4> Go to the download page <a href="../download/">here</a> and go to click in "Download Apache Spot".<br><br>

Selecting a value from each list will narrow down the coincidences, therefore if the analyst

                    <p><strong>Scoring Frame</strong><br>The main function in this frame is to allow the Analyst to score IP Addresses and DNS records with different values. In order to assign a risk to a specific

                      down the coincidences, therefore if the analyst wishes to score all connections with one same relevant attribute (i.e. ip address 10.1.1.1), then select only the combo boxes that are relevant and leave the rest at the first row at
                      the top.</p>

                    <p>You can score a large set of similar or coincident queries by entering a keyword in the "Quick Scoring" text field and then select a severity value from the radiobutton list. The value entered here will only search for matches on the

            <h3>Complete guide to run a plugin on SPOT web app</h3>

            <p>Developers now can do a little plugin and put it on SPOT. They only need to follow next steps to reach their goal.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Before start, we need to know a few things.
                <ul>
                  <li>JSON:  is a text to transmit data objects consisting of any serializable value. We need to know the basics because the plugin is composed by JSON.</li>
                  <li>JSON-SCHEMA-FORM: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form" target="_blank">https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form</a></li>
                  <li>GraphQL: <a href="http://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank">http://graphql.org/learn/</a></li>
                  <li>And some other backend-language if you want to connect your plugin to some 3rd party service or API’s.</li>
                  <li>Python basics</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Next step is know where the plugin will be placed. Nowadays we have 2 type of widget, Menu type, Scoring Type.</p>
                <p>Menu type is just a link to a web app inside your plugin’s folder.</p>

                <p><img src="images/plugins-1.png" alt=""  /></p>

                <p>All Menu type plugin will be placed inside Plugins menu. If there is none Menu type, the UI will recognize it. After that plugins menu will disappear.</p>

                <p><img src="images/plugins-2.png" alt=""  /></p>

                <p>For the other hand scoring type Plugin is placed inside Scoring Panel.</p>

                <p><img src="images/plugins-3.png" alt=""  /></p>

                <p>In the same case as Menu, if there is no plugins for this specific pipeline, scoring will take all space:</p>

                <p class="center"><img src="images/plugins-4.png" alt=""  /></p>

                <h3>Configure and enable the widget</h3>

                <p>From the top right menu, you can click on the mesh icon to display the configuration options and select the ‘Manage Plugins’ option to display the plugin manager section.</p>

                <p><img src="images/plugins-5.png" alt=""  /></p>
                <p><img src="images/plugins-6.png" alt=""  /></p>

                <p>To enable or to activate a plugin and start the service, you can just click on the ‘Enable / Disable’ button.</p>

                <p>If the specific plugin requires additional configuration and its json file is properly structured, you can set the configuration values by clicking on the pencil icon. It will open a new window displaying a form for specific requirements of the plugin.</p>
