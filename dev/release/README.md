# **Apache Spot (Incubating) Release Process**

## **Overview**  

This document describes the Release Process to perform the official Apache Spot (Incubating) release following the [Apache Software Foundation Release Policy](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/releasemanagement.html#best-practice). 
 
### **Requirements**

As a Release Manager (RM), you should create a code signing key to sign the release artifacts following this [guide](http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key).

Public key should be detached and added in to the KEYS file in Spot Repo under: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/spot/KEYS

### **Policy documents**

Frequently asked questions for making Apache releases are available on [Releases FAQ page](http://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#releases).

The Release Manager must go through the policy document to understand all the tasks and responsibilities of running a release.

### **Give a heads up**

The release manager should create an EPIC in Jira and then setup a timeline for release branch point. The time for the day the EPIC is created to the release branch point must be at least two weeks in order to give the community a chance to prioritize and commit any last minute features and issues they would like to see in the upcoming release.

The release manager should then send the pointer to the EPIC along with the tentative timeline (Code Freeze) for branch point to the user and developer lists. Any work identified as release related that needs to be completed should be added as a subtask of the umbrella issue to allow users to see the overall release progress in one place.

    To: dev@spot.apache.org

    Subject: Work on Spot <your release name>  (Incubating) Release has started + Code Freeze Date


    We are starting the process to prepare for Spot <your release name> (Incubating) release. I have opened JIRA $jira to cover the features included in this release.

    If you have any JIRA in progress and would like to include in this release, please follow the process to do so. Code Freeze for final integration will be on $code_freeze_date.

    Feel free to comment on the JIRA if you have any comments/suggestions.

    Thanks,
    <Release Manager Name>

### **Sanitize Jira**

Before a release is done, make sure that any issues that are fixed have their fix version setup correctly. If the release number is not listed in the "fix version" field, as RM create a ticket for Infrastructure asking to create the value for the "fix version" field. 

Once the value is created by Infrastructure team, run the following JIRA query to see which resolved issues do not have their fix version set up correctly:

project = spot and resolution = fixed and fixVersion is empty

The result of the above query should be empty. If some issues do show up in this query that have been fixed since the last release, please bulk-edit them to set the fix version to '1.0'.

You can also run the following query to make sure that the issues fixed for the to-be-released version look accurate:

project = spot and resolution = fixed and fixVersion = '1.0'

### **Monitor active issues**

It is important that between the time that the umbrella issue is filed to the time when the release branch is created, no experimental or potentially destabilizing work is checked into the trunk. While it is acceptable to introduce major changes, they must be thoroughly reviewed and have good test coverage to ensure that the release branch does not start of being unstable.

If necessary the RM can discuss if certain issues should be fixed on the trunk in this time, and if so what is the gating criteria for accepting them.

### **Pull Request Validation**

All the features that will be included in the release EPIC needs to have a proper Pull Request (PR) created following this guide. And needs three +1 votes which at least one of them must be from the QA Team. 

Development must be done in to a Topic Branch or Master Branch, depending on the scope of the release.

Once the PR has votes, then the PPMC developer must merge the PR and the owner of that PR should close it properly in Github (in case it does not close automatically).

If Development is performed in Topic Branch, then Topic Branch should be merged in to master branch once development is done. 

### **Create the Release Candidate**

The Release candidate branch will be created from Master branch once all pull requests form the EPIC are merged to a topic branch or directly to master branch before code freeze date.

#### **Branch your release:**

* git checkout -b `<your release name>` `<commit sha1>` 

push to origin:

* git push origin `<your release name>`

#### **Tag your Branch release:**
Apply signed tag on release branch that will indicate where the release candidate was generated.

Example:
* git tag -u `<GPG KEY ID>` --sign `<your release name>`-incubating -m "Apache Spot `<your release name>` (Incubating)" `<SHA of HEAD of branch>`

### **Run RAT**
Apache Rat is a release audit tool, focused on licenses. Used to improve accuracy and efficiency when checking releases for licenses.

Download RAT: 
* wget http://apache.claz.org//creadur/apache-rat-0.12/apache-rat-0.12-bin.tar.gz

Decompress the code:
* tar -zxvf apache-rat-0.12-bin.tar.gz
* cd apache-rat-0.12

Now lets create the file to exclude the known extensions and files:
* vi or nano .rat-excludes

Add the following exclude list:

    .*md
    .*txt
    .gitignore
    .gitmodules
    .*png
    .*json
    .*csvss
    .*less
    .*ipynb
    .babelrc
    topojson.min.js

Save the File.

Or download the .rat-excludes files from: https://github.com/apache/incubator-spot/blob/master/dev/release/.rat-excludes

Run the rat tool as following.
* java -jar apache-rat-0.12.jar -E /path/to/project/.rat-excludes -d /path/to/project/ > `<to output file>`.txt

If you have rat in the same directory as the Spot Code you can verify as:
* java -jar apache-rat-0.12.jar -E .rat-excludes -d ../apache-spot-1.0-incubating > apache-spot-1.0-incubating-rat-results.txt

If RAT find problems in the licenses please fix the licence and run RAT again developers must fix their code and submit changes into the release branch, once there are no more findings. Upload RAT Results into subversion dev incubator repo for Spot of the release

#### **Make a tarball and gzip:**
* git archive -o ../apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar --prefix=apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating/ `<your tag/branch name>`
* gzip ../apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar

Example:

    $ git archive -o ../apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar --prefix=apache-spot-1.0-incubating/ 1.0-incubating
    $ gzip ../apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar

#### **Prepare MD5, SHA512 and ASC files from the source tarball:**

* md5 apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar.gz > apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar.gz.md5
* shasum -a 512 apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar.gz > apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar.gz.sha512 
* gpg2 --detach-sign -a apache-spot-`<your release name>`-incubating.tar.gz

Example:

    $ md5 apache-spot-1.0-incubating..tar.gz > apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar.gz.md5
    $ shasum -a 512 apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar.gz > apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar.gz.sha512
    $ gpg2 --detach-sign -a apache-spot-1.0-incubating..tar.gz
 

#### **Retrieve the subversion dev incubator repo for Spot**

Example:
* svn checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/spot/ --username=`<your apache user>`
 
Create a local folder for the release (e.g. 1.0-incubating) in svn. 
* svn mkdir -m "Creating Spot `<release number>` dir" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/spot/`<release number>` --username=`<your apache user>`

Example:

    svn mkdir -m "Creating Spot 1.0-incubating dir" https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/spot/1.0-incuabting --username=`<your apache user>`


Move the files into the release folder on local disk.
* svn add `<release folder>`

Example:

    svn add 1.0-incubating/

Commit artifacts:
* svn commit -m '`<custom message>`' --username=`<your apache user id>`

Example:

    svn commit -m 'adding spot 1.0-incubating candidate release artifacts' --username=`<your apache user id>`

## **Validate the Build**

Download the tarball.

* http://spot.apache.org/download

Decompress the tarball. Instruction:
    
    tar -zxvf apache-spot-1.0-incubating.tar.gz

Change directory. Instruction:
    
    cd apache-spot-1.0-incubator

Apache Spot (incubating) is composed of more than one module or sub-projects. Since some of them are Python or Javascript code, they donâ€™t need compilation.

    DISCLAIMER

    Apache Spot (incubating) is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC.
    Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects.

    While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

### **Call for Incubator PMC Vote**

The second voting is the most important since it is required to get three +1 (Binding) vote from the IPMC members from the Incubator General list to declare an official release.

Send the vote to the general Incubator list and include the voting results from the dev list as evidence. 

    To: general@incubator.apache.org
    Subject: [VOTE] Release Apache Spot 1.0-incubating

    Dear IPMC team,

    This is the vote for Apache Spot 1.0 (incubating) release. This is the first release of Spot.

    Apache Spot (Incubating) is open source software for leveraging insights from flow and packet analysis. It helps enterprises and service providers gain insight on their network environments through transparency of service delivery and identification of potential security threats or attacks happening among resources operating at cloud scale. While current threat intelligence tools help, identifying unknown threats and attacks remains a challenge. Apache Spot provides tools to accelerate companiesâ€™ ability to expose suspicious connections and previously unseen attacks using flow and packet analysis technologies.
