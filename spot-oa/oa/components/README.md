### Data
_Data source module._

This module needs to be configured correctly to avoid errors during the spot-oa execution. Here you need to select the correct database engine to obtain the correct results while creating additional details files.
Currently spot-oa includes the modules to work with either Hive or Impala. By default is set to work with Impala, but you can always configure any other database engine, create the corresponding python module and make the corresponding changes in the code.

**Configuration**

You need to update the _engine.json_ file accordingly:

        {
            "oa_data_engine":"<database engine>",
            
            "impala":{
                "impala_daemon":"<node>"
            },
            "hive":{}
        }

Where:
- <database engine>: Whichever database engine you have installed and configured in your cluster to work with Apache Spot (incubating). i.e. "Impala" or "Hive".
For this key, the value you enter needs to match exactly with one of the following keys, where you'll need to add the corresponding node name. 
- <node>: The node name in your cluster where you have the database service running. 

Example:

    {
        "oa_data_engine":"impala",        
        "impala":{
            "impala_daemon":"workernode07"
        },
        "hive":{}
    }


### Reputation
_Reputation check module._

This module is called during spot-oa execution to check the reputation for any given IP, DNS name or URI (depending on the pipeline). The reputation module makes use of two third-party services, McAfee GTI and Facebook ThreatExchange. 
Each of these services are represented by a sub-module in this project, McAfee GTI is implemented by sub-module gti and Facebook ThreatExchange by sub-module fb. For more information see Folder Structure section.

**Pre-requisites**

- McAfee GTI client and credentials. McAfee GTI client is not included in this project. To get a copy of their [rest client](https://secure.mcafee.com/apps/downloads/my-products/login.aspx?region=us) and credentials 
(server, user, password) get in touch with a McAfeeÂ® representative at Licensing@McAfee.com. *If you are not interested on using McAfee GTI or you are not McAfee customer you can disable McAfee GTI reputation check.*

- Facebook API Key. To enable the Facebook ThreatExchange service, it is required to obtain first an API Key. To learn more about how to get an API Key go to [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/). *If you are not interested on using Facebook ThreatExchange you can disable ThreatExchange reputation check.*

**Enable/Disable GTI service**

It's possible to disable any of the reputation services mentioned above, all it takes is to remove the configuration for the undesired service in gti_config.json. To learn more about it, see the section below.
To add a different reputation service, you can read all about it [here](reputation)

**Configuration**

- reputation_config.json: Stores a list of reputation services to call during spot-oa execution. Also it contains a list of columns to check
 reputation. gti_config.json looks like this:

        {
            "gti":{
                "server" : "<server>",
                "user" : "<user>",
                "password" : "<password>",
                "ci" : "{\"ci\":{\"cliid\":\"<cliid>\", \"prn\":\"<prn>\", \"sdkv\":\"1.0\", \"pv\":\"1.0.0\", \"pev\":1, \"rid\":1, \"affid\":\"0\"},\"q\":[###QUERY###]}",
                "refclient" : "<refclient location>",
                "category_file":"<gti_cat_codes file location>"
            },
            "fb":{
                "app_id" : "<app_id>",
                "app_secret" : "<app_secret>"
            }
        }
    Where
    - gti: McAfee GTI service connection details. Please note that these values have to be provided by McAfee upon contracting the GTI service.
        - server: string with McAfee GTI server.
        - user: string with McAfee GTI user.
        - password: string with McAfee GTI password.
        - ci: request body for GTI service. This string parameter is formatted as json content,
        be careful with removing scape characters for single quotes and double quotes.

        Do not remove, replace or modify the label ###QUERY###, it's a special placeholder and is required for
        reputation.py to work.
        - prn: you can give a name to your Spot instance like "CompanyX-Spot" or you can just leave as is.
        - refclient: absolute path for restclient, which will be provided by McAfee upon contracting the GTI service. It should be the path where the *restclient* file is
        located without ending backslash i.e.

                /home/solution-user/refclient/restclient

        - category_file: absolute path for the gti category and functional names catalog. This file is also provided by McAfee upon contracting the GTI service.
        This file should be a comma separated text file, including headers for the following columns:
            - Category code: int
            - Category name: string
            - Functional group: string

    - fb: facebook [ThreatExchange](https://developers.facebook.com/products/threat-exchange) service connection details.
        - app_id: App id to connect to ThreatExchange service.
        - app_secret: App secret to connect to ThreatExchange service.

### IANA
_Internet Assigned Numbers Authority codes translation module._

**Configuration**

- iana_config.json:  Stores the location of codes translation files. By default, spot-oa iana module comes with 4 csv files
with different code types for DNS and HTTP queries and usually they will be located in oa/components/iana/. These files can be
moved to any preferred location.

In order to configure this module, replace each value with the absolute path for each IANA codes catalog, for example if IANA code files are in the
default location, your configuration file should look like this:

		{
		    "IANA": {
	             "dns_qry_class":"/home/solution-user/spot-oa/oa/components/iana/dns-qclass.csv",
	             "dns_qry_type":"/home/solution-user/spot-oa/oa/components/iana/dns-qtype.csv",
	              dns_qry_rcode":"/home/solution-user/spot-oa/oa/components/iana/dns-rcode.csv",
	              http_qry_rcode":"/home/solution-user/spot-oa/oa/components/iana/http-rcode.csv"
	          }
		 }


### Network Context (nc)
_Network Context module._

**Pre-requisites**

Before start working with network context module, it is required to have a comma separated network context file.

This file can be placed anywhere in the system running spot-oa, although we suggest you place it inside the _context_ folder to keep uniformity.
The following schema is expected:
-   IP: string
-   Description: String

Example:

        10.192.180.150, NOT IN DNS
        10.192.180.1, Machine name 

**Configuration**

- nc_config.json: replace the value of network_context with the absolute path of networkcontext.csv file, the
configuration file should look like this:

		{
		    NC" : {
                        "network_context_dns" : "/home/solution-user/spot-oa/context/networkcontext.csv"
			   }
		 }

         
### Geoloc
_Geolocation module._

This is an optional functionality you can enable / disable depending on your preferences.

**Pre-requisites**  
To start using this module, you need to include a comma separated file containing the geolocation for most (or all) IPs.
To learn more about the expected schema for this file or where to find a full geolocation db, please refer 
to the  [_context_](/spot-oa/context/README.md) documentation  

 
**Configuration**
Spot-oa is preconfigured to look for the geolocation file at the _~/context/_ path.

Example:

        /home/solution-user/spot-oa/context/iploc.csv
